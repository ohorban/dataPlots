# CS40 Homework2: Visualizing interesting datasets
![meme](complaints-about-weather.png)
**Description:**
    For this homework, I researched data on the topic that interests me - climate change. As it was proven, CO2 emissions play a role in a global waming, so I searched for data that show CO2 emisions in the Unite states. I also took a look at the average annual temperatures in the United States since 1990.

## First plot: Production-based CO2 emissions in the U.S. and CO2emissions as a percentage of global total (1990-2018)

bla bla bla bla

## Second plot: Annual average temperatures in the United States (1990-2018)
