# CS40 Homework2: Visualizing interesting datasets
![meme](complaints-about-weather.png)

**Description:**
    For this homework, I researched data on the topic that interests me - climate change. As it was proven, CO2 emissions play a role in a global warming, so I searched for data that show CO2 emisions in the United states. I also took a look at the average annual temperatures in the United States since 1990. <br />


## First plot: Production-based CO2 emissions in the U.S. and CO2emissions as a percentage of global total (1990-2018)
![firstPlot](CO2plot.png)
As you can see, I have 2 separate bar charts on this graph. The blue one represents the amount of CO2 emmited in the US every year (in hundred million tonnes). The orange bar chart represents the percantage of America's CO2 emission out of global CO2 emmission. There is really nothing else for me to say except the fact that these numbers make me really sad ... :sob:  <br />
Here's the [CO2 data source](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
found through [this page on github](https://github.com/owid/co2-data) and then modified for my purpose <br /> <br /> <br />

## Second plot: Annual average temperatures in the United States (1990-2018)
![secondPlot](temperaturePlot.png)
As you can see, this plot shows the average temperature in the United States, every year since 1990. Honestly, this graph turned out to bve much more chaotic than I expected, and it doesn't really show a trend. This data set, however, is extremly broad. It would be important to take a look at average temperatures during different seasons, across different states to be able to anlyze the data. <br />
